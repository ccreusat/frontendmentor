## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
