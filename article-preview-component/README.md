## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Finally !! Get some time to dig deeper Storybook. I hesitated doing this challenge in React or Angular but but I wanted to improve my storybook knowledge the hard way .... => The HTML doc is almost no-existent :)

I tried to do it differently according to some components to show differents aspects of storybook (description, args, argsTypes, how to create a component in JS or with HTML)

Hope it helps :)
